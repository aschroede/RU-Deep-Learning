Comments:
  Question 2.3 e: |
    The answer says that we have not converged after 10 epochs. However we changed the epochs from 10 to 100 and so for our training run it is correct to say that the training has converged.

  Question 2.5 b: |
    Lost a mark by classifying SGD with LR=0.01 as having converged to a good result.

  Question 2.5 e: |
    Didn't quite talk about validation which is what was expected in the answer for final performance.
